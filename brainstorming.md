Generate New Ideas:
-
1. Kpop Album & Photocard Library
2. Digital Closet
3. Personal Social Media
4. Health Diary Tracker

Evaluating App Ideas:
-
2.1: Kpop Album & Photocard Library
- **Description**: Thinking something along the lines of taking photos of your pcs and saving them to you profiles, and then mark if pcs are up for trade or not (so like a trading forum). Can also be used to store a library of the albums you own
- **Category:** Social Networking / Productivity
- **Mobile:** Since it uses photos and a chat feature, using Mobile is more appropriate
- **Story:** For avid traders and kpop merchandise collectors, keeping track of the photocards and albums you own, want to trade, and have traded is difficult. This makes the process much easier to keep track of while building a community of people who are alike.
- **Market:** for the kpop community since it has to do with kpop merch trades. But the community is pretty big considering that the biggest sources of revenue for the industry comes from merchandise sales.
- **Habit:** If the user is a trader, somewhat frequently since they would try to track down what other user has a pc that they want or any requests they might recieve for a pc that they own.
- **Scope:** A challenge, I think a stripped down version would be possible tho. Something that just displays what the main functionality would look like.

2.2: Digital Closet
- Take photos of individual clothes/shoes/accessories and also full outfits and store them in personal boards and subboards

2.3: Personal Social Media
- **Description**: The same way discord has servers, but they are friend group rooms or any group really that you can have a personal instagram/tumblr like feed; maybe a feature in profiles to share most listened to song(s) from a spotify API (?) or like their followed reddit pages (is there a feature like this in reddits api?)
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** To share photos and videos and keep up with friends real time is mostly done on Mobile. Using a website would seem weird.
- **Story:** Encourages healthier socialization amongst friends without worrying about the psychological withdraw that comes with using a bigger platform like instagram
- **Market:** anyone, might appeal to a younger audience thought. This is especially great for those who have social anxiety but feel comfortable sharing if it's with friends 
- **Habit:** Probably frequently used since the idea involves some real time stuff like spotify now playing song, and can be seen as a groupchat amongst friends but taken to the next level
- **Scope:** Would be a challenge but I can try to make a stripped down version that just includes one group at app startup only and implement the feature assuming that. future implementation would include making it possible to choose several groups

2.4: Health Diary Tracker
- **Description**: Called "Amai/あまい" meaning sweet in japanese, aimed for those who are prediabetic, or diabetic trying to keep track of their eating habits, blood sugar, and medications; get ideas for meals and recipes; maybe even make it a gamified to encourage consistent tracking; i could also add a blood pressure feature 
- **Category:** Productivity / Health
- **Mobile:** Mobile allows for easy tracking throughout the day, no login required, without the need of pulling up a browser multiple times a day
- **Story:** Encourages health awareness
- **Market:** people with health problems/concers specifically those with diabetes or blood pressure problems
- **Habit:** frequently used since the user would track several times a day, more if they frequently experience things that they feel they would need to take note on 
- **Scope:** it's the most manageable amongst my ideas since i can implement a stripped down version using what I learned throughout IOS 101 with little outside research unlike the previous ideas
