## Overview

### Description

Amai is a health tracker app aimed to help people who struggle with health problems keep track of their wellbeing. It is specifically aimed at those who struggle with diabetic symptoms (Pre-Diabetes, Diabetes I, Diabetes II) and need help tracking their food intake and glucose levels, hence the name "Amai", the romanization of the Japanese word あまい, meaning sweet. While the goal is to keep track of details such as blood sugar levels, there is also features like a heart rate tracker and notes section. This allows the app to also provide a general outlet for the users thoughts and emotions. My vision for this app is something minimalistic and is easy to navigate in order to increase accessibility. This project was inspired by my mother who struggles with health issues.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Health / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Mobile allows for easy tracking throughout the day, no login required, without the need of opening a browser. 
- **Story:** Encourages physical and mental wellbeing. User will be more aware of their health and it will motivate them to take control of what they can, such as their diet.
- **Market:** To all who wish to start taking control of their health, but more specifically geared those who suffer from diabetes and heart related issues.
- **Habit:** Users who are most active, or have the severe need to track multiple times, are using this throughout the day. The average user will probably make one daily entry in the diary section.
- **Scope:** The current goal is a stripped down version of my vision for this app. Therefore, it should be achieveable for the most part with my current skillset. However, the current implementation wouldn't be some stagnant idea. There are many more possibilities to add further down the line.
